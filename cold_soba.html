        <h2> Description </h2>

            <p> This is how to make zaru soba, or cold soba. It is a popular dish in the summertime in Japan. Soba is both nutritious and delcious, and eating it cold provides some relief from the hot and humid summers. </p>

            <p> I will briefly describe how I make this dish for myself. </p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Uncooked soba </li>
                <li lang="jp"> めんつゆ </li>
                <li> Cold water and ice cubes </li>
                <li> Wasabi </li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Directions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> First, bring a pot of water to boil. It should be enough to completely submerge your soba. </li>
                <li> Next, you want to add your bundles of soba to the pot, and cook them simmering but not rolling boiling water for about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> In a small bowl, prepare the tsuyu. It's two parts water to one part tsuyu.</li>
                <li> Add a small amount of wasabi to the tsuyu and break it up to try and dissolve it </li>
                <li> When the noodles are cooked, strain them and rinse them gently with cold water. </li>
                <li> Place the drained, cooled soba noodles in a shallow bowl or plate, and drop an ice cube or two into your tsuyu. </li>
                <li> Dip the noodles and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
